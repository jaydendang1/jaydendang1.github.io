          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Interests in I.T</b></h5>
		  <ul>
         <li>My interest in IT is computers and computer software as well as social security. I first came within interest with I.T when I first built my own gaming computer with my friends. I later had a greater in interest as I realised that the future of countries is technology and that there will always have jobs for those that are experts at I.T.</li>

		 <li>. I chose to go to RMIT because RMIT is known to be the best course for I.T.

		  <ul>
          <li>As a network engineer, the position would be high in the work company as it is a difficult job and requires expert problem-solving skills as well as perfect organisation and time prioritising. This position appeals to me because this job is needed throughout work companies, meaning others rely on network engineers to also allow them to do their jobs. It also appeals to me because it requires independent work meaning it requires me to be a self-starter and taking initiative for future and ongoing projects.</li>
		  <li>General requirements and skills you need for this job is to have expert experience in network engineering and the ability to create, implement and support network infrastructure as well having high experience with router/switching, network securities and have experience with Microsoft or Linux. </li>
		  <li>This job also requires having team skills, meaning to have strong communication skills and to be able to prioritise goals.</li>
		  <li>Generally, for this job you need to have a degree in information technology, computer science and computer engineering etc. </li>

		  <h6>Qualifications and Skills Required</h6>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Currently I am known to have leadership skills and taking initiative but have no qualifications yet, as I am still first year student for bachelors degree of information technology.</li>
		  <li>I have experience in soldering and creating Bluetooth devices for blinds and I have built my own gaming computer.</li>
		  <li>I plan on obtaining qualification to become a network engineer by finishing my degree in RMIT and building experience as well as skills by working jobs that are related to network engineering.</li>

          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Meaning of Results</b></h5>
		  <ul>
          <p>These results would mean that I would be a team player in the team and will communicate well with the group. I would also be able to work out problems that the team may have and keep a healthy environment for the team to work in. When forming a team, I should consider not having more than 2 extroversions as they like to be the centre of attention and like to be the leader of a team. </p>
