          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Interests in I.T</b></h5>
		  <ul>
         <li>My interest in IT is computers and computer software as well as social security. I first came within interest with I.T when I first built my own gaming computer with my friends. I later had a greater in interest as I realised that the future of countries is technology and that there will always have jobs for those that are experts at I.T.</li>
		 <li>I have experience with Java Scripting when creating simple movements for games such as moving the character up, down, left and right and I have also soldered a few things for Bluetooth window blinds.</li>
		 <li>. I chose to go to RMIT because RMIT is known to be the best course for I.T. I expect to learn coding and new life skills that will help me adapt to the rapid evolution of the earth in relation to technology, as well as skills that allow me to use my creativity to create new programs to assist the future in advancing into a better world.</li>

          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Ideal Job - (Network Engineer)</b></h5>
		  <ul>
          <li>As a network engineer, the position would be high in the work company as it is a difficult job and requires expert problem-solving skills as well as perfect organisation and time prioritising. This position appeals to me because this job is needed throughout work companies, meaning others rely on network engineers to also allow them to do their jobs. It also appeals to me because it requires independent work meaning it requires me to be a self-starter and taking initiative for future and ongoing projects.</li>
		  <li>General requirements and skills you need for this job is to have expert experience in network engineering and the ability to create, implement and support network infrastructure as well having high experience with router/switching, network securities and have experience with Microsoft or Linux. </li>
		  <li>This job also requires having team skills, meaning to have strong communication skills and to be able to prioritise goals.</li>
		  <li>Generally, for this job you need to have a degree in information technology, computer science and computer engineering etc. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h6>Qualifications and Skills Required</h6>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Currently I am known to have leadership skills and taking initiative but have no qualifications yet, as I am still first year student for bachelors degree of information technology.</li>
		  <li>I have experience in soldering and creating Bluetooth devices for blinds and I have built my own gaming computer.</li>
		  <li>I plan on obtaining qualification to become a network engineer by finishing my degree in RMIT and building experience as well as skills by working jobs that are related to network engineering.</li>

          <li>These results would mean that I would be a team player in the team and will communicate well with the group. I would also be able to work out problems that the team may have and keep a healthy environment for the team to work in. When forming a team, I should consider not having more than 2 extroversions as they like to be the centre of attention and like to be the leader of a team.</li>

          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Project Idea - Brawlr</b></h5>
          <h6>Overview</h6>
		  <ul>
		  <li>This project will be an app that connects people from local areas to start fights with. A similar app is tinder where others connect to find love or friendship, whereas this app is to connect to others that want to meet up and fight.</li>
		  <li>The concept of this app is for the user to scroll through different fighter's profiles and selecting which fighter they would want to fight. If there is a match between two fighters, the app will connect the two users together where they can communicate, and which will lead them onto the fight.</li>
		  <li>This app will be like the background creation of tinder but cheaper. This project is not a serious project as I believe many will not just have an app to find a local fight. It is a humorous take on social matching apps such as tinder and Grindr.</li>
		  <li>The app will be called Brawlr.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h6>Motivation</h6>
		  <ul>
		  <p>My motivation is to create something more innovative and different from typical social applications. Tinder, Bumble, Grindr all have the same concept of creating friendships or relationships. Whereas, my app will allow people to release frustration and anger on each other, something no other application provides. This could be a cheap way for fighters to train and perfect their skills by fighting many different fighters. There are about 1.5million people using tinder worldwide and 2.4million users active daily on Grindr, this shows how popular matching apps are in society.</p>
		  </ul>
		  <h6>Description<h6>
		  <ul>
		  <p>This app will be available for both platforms of IOS apple and Android. Upon opening the app users will be able to create a profile via email, google play account, apple account or social media accounts such as Facebook and Twitter. Furthermore, they will have to input their real details, such as full name, date of birth, address and phone number. They will have to prove this information by submitting a form of identification such as a driver's licence, passport or mail. They will also have to verify their email. Creating a profile will be strict as we don't want any fake accounts or accounts that don't take the app seriously. Upon signing into the account, the app will ask for permission to use location services and access to photos and files.  It will then sync the local location and show the user how far away other users are from them that also want to fight. It will then give the user an option to either swipe right or left on another user's profile, meaning when swiping left they have an option to ignore the person or swipe right to agree to fight the user. Upon swiping left or right users will be able to see basic information of the user, such as age, fighting type and body build. Furthermore, if a user swipes right on a user's profile and the user agrees to fight it will allow them to chat to each other. This app will create a community of enthusiastic fighters and bringing people together with the same interests of brawling. It provides the same services as matching apps as it shows users what type of fighters are around, and they can match up with them. This app will available for only Australia first and soon to all the world. There will be in app purchases to have more swipes and free users will be able to have up to 10 swipes a day. There will also be match suggestions depending on the user's profile and the app will provide push notifications when a user has been matched up with.</p>
		  </ul>
		  <h6>Tools and Technologies<h6>
		  <ul>
		  <li>To create this app in a basic form I would be using android app maker which is a free application to create apps without coding. However, it I wanted to advance this app I would have to do the coding myself through java scripting, python and HTML5 to be used as programming languages. Furthermore, we would use AWS Hub as a mobile platform to build and test the app when it is done.</li>
		  <li>Additionally, geolocation is the basis of this application as it connects real users together from certain locations. We would be using google or apple locations maps services to implement geolocation into this app. For android I would apply the classes of Android.Location package and MapView class. For iOS we would be using CLLocationManager Class and Map Kit Framework. </li>
		  <li>For the in app purchases we would be offering users to be able to use paypal or credit card. This is a similar development as how tinder was created.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h6>Skills Required<h6>
		  <ul>
		  <p>For this app the skills that are required is coding, designing and app development as well as having patience. It will also require some knowledge on android and iOS applications developing skills. To create this app, it will require a computer and coding programs such as JavaScript and Python. Finding these skills will be feasible as 1st year students that do information technology in university are able to do it. The app will only be available to the phone and finding the right programs and software for the app is available online.<p>
		  </ul>
		  <h6>Outcome<h6>
		  <ul>
		  <p>If this application were to be successful there would be an increased rate of violence around the world. The original problem was that there were too many identical applications that provide match making services such as tinder. By creating this application, I have changed the world of match making apps and have created a different category. By creating this application this allows others to bring out frustration on others and will allow others to connect to each other by fighting. However, creating this application would increase violence and increase hospital visits and would cost a lot of money.<p>
